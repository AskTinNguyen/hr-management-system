# HR Management System - Project Progress

## Project Overview
The HR Management System is a comprehensive web application built with Next.js and Supabase, designed to streamline HR operations including employee management, attendance tracking, payroll processing, and more.

## Current Status
As of March 1, 2024, we have implemented the following components and features:

### Authentication
- Login page with email/password authentication
- Authentication middleware for protected routes
- Session management with Supabase Auth

### Layout and UI
- Dashboard layout with responsive sidebar navigation
- Dark/light theme support
- UI components using shadcn/ui

### Dashboard
- Overview statistics (employee count, departments, positions)
- Placeholder sections for recent activity and upcoming events

### Employee Management
- Employee listing page with table view
- Employee data fetching from Supabase with related data (departments, positions)
- Employee table component with actions (view, edit, delete)
- Employee form component for adding/editing employees
- Employee detail view page
- Add employee page
- Edit employee page

### Attendance Management
- Attendance listing page with table view
- Attendance data fetching from Supabase with related employee data
- Attendance table component with actions (view, edit, delete)
- Attendance form component for recording attendance
- Record attendance page

### Leave Management
- Leave requests listing page with table view
- Leave data fetching from Supabase with related employee data
- Leave table component with actions (view, approve, reject)
- Leave request form component for submitting leave requests
- Submit leave request page
- Approve/reject functionality for leave requests

## Next Steps

### Short-term Tasks
1. ✅ Create the "Add Employee" page using the employee form component
2. ✅ Implement the employee detail view page
3. ✅ Complete the employee edit functionality
4. ✅ Implement attendance tracking system
5. ✅ Implement leave management system
6. Implement employee deletion with confirmation
7. Add form validation and error handling
8. Fix TypeScript linting errors in components

### Medium-term Tasks
1. Implement department management module
2. Implement position management module
3. Develop payroll calculation features
4. Add reporting capabilities
5. Implement view/edit/delete functionality for attendance records
6. Implement view details functionality for leave requests

### Long-term Tasks
1. Implement user roles and permissions
2. Add document management for employee files
3. Create performance evaluation system
4. Add notification system for important events

## Technical Debt
- Fix TypeScript linting errors in components
- Improve error handling and loading states
- Add comprehensive test coverage
- Optimize database queries for performance
- Implement proper data validation on the server side
- Create Supabase tables for attendance and leave management

## Dependencies
- Next.js for the frontend framework
- Supabase for backend and authentication
- shadcn/ui for UI components
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- React Hook Form for form handling
- Zod for schema validation

## Notes
- The current implementation focuses on core functionality
- UI/UX improvements will be addressed in future iterations
- Performance optimization will be needed as the application scales
- Need to implement proper error handling for API calls
